# Healthcare Analytics Leader | Risk Stratification & ML Pipelines | Delivering Scalable Solutions  

### 👋 Hi, I'm Grace Friel  

**Advancing healthcare through analytics and leadership.**  

I lead the **Population Health Analytics** team at Independent Health, where we create enterprise-wide risk stratifications that drive smarter member engagement. These stratifications guide case manager and nurse outreach, ensuring the right members receive the right care at the right time. My team then evaluates the effectiveness of that engagement, closing the loop from insight to impact. By combining advanced analytics, program evaluation, and machine learning, we shape strategies that elevate member experience while reducing avoidable costs.  

With over 25 years in research, program evaluation, and predictive modeling, I bring both technical expertise and strategic leadership. My team is building the people, processes, and machine learning pipelines to support multiple predictive models in production. These pipelines automate data flow, model scoring, and evaluation, positioning us to scale analytics across the enterprise. My leadership has been recognized internally through innovation awards and externally as a featured speaker at Milliman HealthVision 360 on Medicare risk stratification.
